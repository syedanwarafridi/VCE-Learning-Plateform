But PDF has 3x=2u, x=2u/3, then A= (2u/3) (u - 2u/3) = (2u/3)(u/3) = 2u^2 /9. Why 2u/3? Perhaps the rectangle is from 0 to x, height u, but no, diagram shows from O to Q at x, but shaded OMQN, perhaps M N at y=u and y=0, but for |x|, it's V shape. Perhaps the rectangle is inscribed with sides parallel, but solution treats as A = x (u - x), but then x=u/2, A=u^2/4. But PDF has u - x - x^2 / (2u - x) or something, wait, solution has dA/dx = u - x - x =0, u - 2x =0, but text u - x - x /2u - x =0? Wait, the PDF solution has for max, u - x - x / (2u - x) =0? No, text 'u−x−x 2u−x=0', perhaps A = x (u - x) / (something), but logical estimate as per solution max area 2 u^2 / 9.",
