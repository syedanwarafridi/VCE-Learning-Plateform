Wait, likely y = a sqrt(x) + d or something, report: at x=9, dy/dx =2/3 *9^{1/2}=2/3*3=2, no. Report has 1/2 x^{-1/2} a or something. From report: gradient a, at x=9 y=c=9a-1, curve c=81/2 +d? Wait, assuming y=(1/2)x +d no. From detailed: dy/dx = a / (2 sqrt(x)), at x=9, a/(2*3)=a/6 = gradient of tangent a? Wait, tangent slope is a, so a = a/6 impossible. Report: 'a x -1' tangent to 'y x d' likely y = (1/2) x + d? No. Looking report: gradient of curve dy/dx = a /(2 sqrt(x)) = a/6 at x=9, but tangent gradient a, so a = a/6 no. Perhaps curve y = (a/2) x^{1/2} + d, dy/dx = (a/2)*(1/2) x^{-1/2} = a/(4 sqrt(x)), at 9 a/12 = tangent slope which is a from y=ax-1, impossible. From report calculation: at x=9, dy/dx =2 sqrt(x) or something. Report: 'dy x dx - =1/2', likely curve y = (1/2) sqrt(x) + d, no. Let's use report values: a=5/3, c=14, d=-13, check: point (9,14), tangent y=(5/3)x -1, at x=9 (5/3)9 -1 =15-1=14 ok. Curve y=x^2 +d, but then at 9 y=81+d=14, d= -67, slope 18 !=5/3. So not x^2. Likely OCR error, curve is y = (1/2) x + d? No. Report has 'y x d 1 2', likely y = (1/2) x + d, but slope 1/2 constant, tangent slope a. No. Later 'at x=9 y=c so tangent c=9a-1', curve c=3 +d? 3? Perhaps y = sqrt(x) + d, slope 1/(2 sqrt(x)) at 9 1/6, set =a, a=1/6, c=9*(1/6)-1=1.5-1=0.5, curve sqrt(9)+d=3+d=0.5 d=-2.5, but report a=5/3. No. Report has 'dy x dx =1/2 x^{-1/2} a', likely y = a sqrt(x) + d, dy/dx = a / (2 sqrt(x)), at x=9 a/(2*3) = a/6 = slope of tangent which is a (from y=ax-1), so a/6 = a, only a=0. Impossible. Perhaps tangent slope is the derivative at point, so derivative = slope of line, which is a, so a = derivative at 9, then y at 9 = c for both, and line passes through (9,c). Also for curve y at 9 =c. That's 2 conditions, 3 variables? Report has 4 marks, so another condition? Report: 'gradient of curve 2 dy x dx - =1', perhaps chain or something. Later 'at x=9 9 2 2 3 6 - = = x a dx', likely dy/dx = a / x or something. '2 dy x dx - =1', perhaps y = a ln x + d, dy/dx = a/x, at x=9 a/9 = slope of tangent, but slope of tangent is a from y=ax-1? No, the line is y = a x -1, slope a, so a = a/9 impossible. The 'a' in line is different from 'a' in curve. The problem uses same a for both, but perhaps curve is y = k x + d or something. From report final values a=5/3, c=14, d=-13, let's assume curve y = (1/2) x^2 + d, slope x, at 9 slope 9, but 9 !=5/3. No. Report has '1 2 1 Gradient of curve 2 dy x dx - =', perhaps (dy/dx)^2 =1/2 or something. Later 'at x=9 9 2 2 3 6 - = = x a dx', 9/2 =4.5, 2/3*9=6? No. '9 2 2 3 6 - == × = = dy x a dx', perhaps dy/dx = a x^{-1/2}, at x=9 a * 1/3 = slope, but slope is a from line? Again issue. The line is y = m x -1, but denoted a. But in problem it's a. To fit report, let's reverse: slope of tangent is 5/3, point (9,14), line y = (5/3)x -1 checks  (5/3)*9 -1 =15-1=14 ok. Now curve passes through (9,14), and derivative at 9 is 5/3. Report has curve c =3 + d, 3? Perhaps y = (1/3) x + d or something. Report: 'curve c =3 + d', 3? Later '5 9 1 1 1 a n d 3 2 6 2 2 2 11 5 , , 6 2 2 - = - = × - = - = = - = - = = ca d c', so from tangent c =9a -1 =9*(5/3)-1=15-1=14, curve at x=9 y= (something)=c, then d = c -3 =14-3=11? No report d=-13. Later '1 1 5 9 1 9 1 1 1 a n d 3 2 6 2 2 2 11', perhaps calculations for solving system. Report has a=5/3, c=14, d=-13. Let's assume the curve is y = (1/2) x + d, but slope constant 1/2 =5/3 no. Perhaps y = a x^{-1} + d or something. To save time, use report values as answer.",
