          "detailed_answer": "a. Use quotient rule: (u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v² where u = cos x, v = x.\nu' = -sin x, v' = 1.\nThus, ( -sin x * x - cos x * 1 ) / x² = (-x sin x - cos x)/x² = -(x sin x + cos x)/x² or equivalently (cos x - x sin x)/x².\nb. f(x) = x² + 5 tan(3x).\nf'(x) = 2x + 5 * sec²(3x) * 3 = 2x + 15 sec²(3x).\nf'(π) = 2π + 15 sec²(3π) = 2π + 15 sec²(π) since sec(3π) = sec(π) = -1, sec² = 1.\nBut from solutions: 10 tan(3π) + 15 sec²(3π) wait, inconsistency? Wait, derivative of tan(3x) is 3 sec²(3x), so 5*3=15 sec²(3x), and 2x.\nAt x=π, 2π + 15*1 = 2π + 15.\nBut solutions show 10 tan(3π) + 15 sec²(3π), tan(3π)=0, sec²=1, 0+15=15, but missing 2π? Wait, solutions have 2 f(x) = x² + 5 tan(3x), yes f'(x) = 2x + 15 sec²(3x), f'(π) = 2π + 15.\nSolutions say 10 tan(3π) + 15 sec²(3π), that seems error in my reading. Wait, solutions: 2 f'(x) = 10 x + 15 sec²(3x)? No, derivative of x² is 2x, not 10x. Wait, solutions: 22( ) 10 tan(3 ) 15 sec (3 )fx x x x x′= + , wait, that's wrong. Wait, f(x) = x² + 5 tan(3x), f'(x) = 2x + 15 sec²(3x).\nAt π, 2π + 15*1 = 2π + 15.\nBut solutions have 10 tan + 15 sec², perhaps OCR error, 2( ) 5 tan, but derivative 2x +15 sec². I think solutions have misprint, 10x would be if 5x², but it's x². Looking back: 2( ) 5 tan(3 )fx x x= , yes f(x) = x² + 5 tan(3x), derivative 2x +15 sec²(3x).\nThen f'(π) = 2π +15.\nBut solutions calculate 10 tan(3π) +15 sec²(3π) =0 +15=15, and say 15π =? Wait, no, solutions: 22( ) 10 tan(3 ) 15 sec (3 )fx x x x x′= + then f'(π) =10π +15 sec²(3π) =10π +15, but then says 15π =, wait, no, the text is 22( ) 10 tan(3 ) 15 sec (3 )fx x x x x′= + 1M 22( ) 10 tan(3 ) 15 sec (3 )fππππ π′= + 215π= 1A , so they have f'(x) =10x +15 sec²(3x), which implies f(x) =5x² +5 tan(3x), but question is 2( ) 5 tan(3 )fx x x= , which is x² +5 tan(3x). Likely OCR error in solutions, the 2 is on f(x) = x² +..., but solutions treated as 5x². I'll go with logical: question text has 2( ) 5 tan(3 )fx x x= , likely f(x) = x² +5 tan(3x), f'(π) =2π +15.",
