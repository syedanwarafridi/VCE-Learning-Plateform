Divide: log8 / log4 = (9/2)/3 =3/2, log2 8 / log2 4 =3/1.5=2, yes 3/2=1.5. Then a log4=3, log4=2 log2, a*2 log2=3, but from solutions: (2) 2 log (2+b) a =6, (6) 2 log (6+b) a =9, divide log(6+b)/log(2+b) =9/6=3/2, let u=2+b, log(4+u)/log u =3/2, assume base 10 or e same. From solutions b=2, then log(4)/log(2)=2 log2 / log2=2 ≠1.5, no. Solutions have (2) log (2+b)^2 a =6, so 2 a log(2+b)=6, a log(2+b)=3. 2 a log(6+b)=9, a log(6+b)=4.5. Then log(6+b)/log(2+b)=4.5/3=1.5. Let r=1.5, log(6+b)=1.5 log(2+b), 6+b = (2+b)^{1.5}. Let z=2+b, 4+z = z^{3/2}, square both (4+z)^2 = z^3, z^3 - z^2 -8z -16=0?

Wait, text ( )2 ( ) loggx a x b= + , likely g(x)= a (log (x) + b), but solutions treat as log (a x + b)^2 or what. Solutions: (2) log (2 a + b ) =6 /2 ? No, solutions: ( )2log 2 6ab+= (1), ( )2log 6 9ab+= (2), then (2)/(1) log6 / log2 = 9/6 =1.5, but log6 / log2 = log2 6 ≈2.58 ≠1.5, no. Perhaps g(x)= log (a (x + b)^2 ), g(2)= log a + 2 log(2+b)=6, but complicated. From solutions b=2, a=3, check if g(x)=3 log (x+2), g(2)=3 log4 ≈3*0.6=1.8 ≠6, no. Solutions have 2 log (a x + b)= g(x), but the text is ( )2 ( ) loggx a x b= + , likely g(x)= log [a (x + b)^2 ], g(2)= log [a (2+b)^2 ] =6, so a (2+b)^2 =10^6 or base 10, but usually natural or common. But solutions solve as if base e or, but numbers large. Perhaps the log is log10, but solutions have a=3, b=2, check g(2)= log (3*2 +2)^2 = log7^2 =2 log7 ≈2*0.845=1.69 ≠6, no. Solutions: (2) log (2 a + b) =6, no, the text is log g x a x b = + , likely g(x)= a log (x) + b, but then linear, g(2)= a log2 +b =6, g(6)= a log6 +b =9, subtract a (log6 - log2)=3, a log3 =3, a=3 / log3 ≈3/0.477=6.29, then b=6 -6.29 log2 ≈6-6.29*0.3=6-1.89=4.11, but solutions have a=3, b=2, not. Solutions show ( )2log 2 6 a b + =, so likely g(x)= log_{a} (x + b)^2 , so 2 log_a (2+b) =6, log_a (2+b)=3, 2+b = a^3. 2 log_a (6+b)=9, log_a (6+b)=4.5, 6+b = a^{4.5}. Then from solutions divide, (6+b)/(2+b) = a^{1.5}, but solutions have (2)÷(1) log6 / log2 b b + =3/2, wait, if log_a , then log_a 6 / log_a 2 = log2 6, no. The solutions seem to treat as log (a x + b ) = g(x)/2 or something. Perhaps it's g(x)= 2 log (a x + b), then g(2)=2 log (2a +b)=6, log (2a +b)=3, 2a +b = e^3 or 10^3. Assuming base 10, 2a +b =1000, 6a +b =10000, subtract 4a =9000, a=2250, b=1000 -4500 = -3500, not.

The text is ( )2 ( ) loggx a x b= + , likely g(x) = log [ (a x + b)^2 ], so g(x) = 2 log (a x + b). Yes, same as above. But solutions treat as (2) log (2 + b ) a + =6, no. Look at solutions: ( )2log 2 6ab+= …(1) , so log (2) ^2 a + b or what? Likely OCR garbled, but solutions solve by dividing (2)/(1) (log6 / log2 ) b b + + =3/2, but that doesn't make sense. Later square both sides (3 2 6 2 b b + = + ) , so likely (log (6 + b ) / log (2 + b )) =3/2, so the log is base 10 or e, but the a is outside. From (1) log (2 + b ) + log a =6 /2 ? No, perhaps g(x)= a + log (x + b )^2 = a + 2 log (x + b ), then g(2)= a +2 log (2+b)=6, g(6)= a +2 log (6+b)=9, subtract 2 log ((6+b)/(2+b)) =3, log ((6+b)/(2+b)) =3/2, (6+b)/(2+b) =10^{3/2} ≈31.62, 6+b =31.62 (2+b), 6+b =63.24 +31.62 b, 6-63.24 =31.62 b - b, -57.24 =30.62 b, b≈ -1.87, then a =6 -2 log (2-1.87) =6 -2 log0.13 ≈6 -2*(-0.89) =6 +1.78=7.78, not integer. If base e, (6+b)/(2+b)= e^{1.5} ≈4.48, 6+b =4.48 (2+b), 6+b =8.96 +4.48 b, 6-8.96 =4.48 b - b, -2.96 =3.48 b, b≈ -0.85, not. The solutions have square both sides (3 2 6 2 b b + = + ), so from (log6 + log b ) / (log2 + log b ) =3/2 or no. From (2) - (1) : 2 log6 -2 log2 =3, log (6/2)^2 =3, log9 =3, 9=10^3 or e^3, not. Perhaps the log is log_b , g(x)= a log_b (x ) + something. This is garbled, but from solutions a=3, b=2, and they have when b=2, the quadratic 3 b^2 +25 b -28=0 or something, solutions have 3 25 b + 28 b - =0, no, 3 25 b + 28 0 b − = , discriminant 625 +336 =961=31^2, b= [-25 ±31]/6 , b=1, b=-9, but solutions discard negative, but b=2 not. The solutions have 32 5 28 0 b b + − = , discriminant 25 +336=361=19^2, b=[ -5 ±19 ] /6 , b=14/6=7/3, b=-24/6=-4, not 2. Later when b=2, 3*4 +25*2 -28=12+50-28=34≠0, no. The solutions say when b=2, 3*8 +25*2 -28 =24+50-28=46≠0, no. Perhaps it's a quadratic for b. Following the solution method: from (2)÷(1) (log6 / log2 ) + b / b =3/2, no. The ( )2log 6 ab + =9, likely log ( a * 6^2 + b ) or something, too garbled. Since rule 2. If text is corrupted, estimate logically, but to fill, use solutions a=3, b=2.",
