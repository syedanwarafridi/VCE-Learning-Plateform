Set x=0, y=0: 0 -32 - a/4 = (8 - a/16) (-4). -32 - a/4 = -32 + (4 a)/16 = -32 + a/4. -32 - a/4 = -32 + a/4, - a/4 - a/4 =0, - a/2 =0, a=0. Still not. Solution has dy/dx = a + 1/8 x or no. From solution text: dy/dx = a x + 1/8? Wait, text has dy/dx = a x + 1/8? No. Solution: At 4, dy/dx = a*4, wait.

Still. Perhaps y = a x + 8 / x. y = a x + 8 / x, y' = a - 8 / x^2. y(4) =4 a +8/4 =4 a +2. Slope from origin to point = (4 a +2)/4 = a +1/2. Set equal: a -8/16 = a -1/2 = a +1/2? No. a -0.5 = a +0.5, no. From solution: find 1/8 dy/dx = a + , wait. Solution text: dy/dx = a + 1/8 x? No. Text: dy dx a = + 1/8, wait, perhaps dy/dx = a + 8/x or something. Assume y = a x^2 + b, but to match a=-4, and tip: substitute a=-4 into dy/dx =1/4 x or something. Tip: dy/dx = (1/4) x, no. Tip: dy/dx = x/4, for a=-4, the equation of tangent is y=2 x. Point (4,2) on it. So reverse: point (4,2), slope 2, y=2 x passes origin. So y(4) =2, y' (4) =2. Assume y = a x^2 + b x + c, but simple, perhaps y = a x^2, but. If y' = 2 a x, y' (4) =8 a =2, a=1/4, y(4) = a*16 =4, but point (4,4), slope 2, tangent y-4 =2 (x-4), at x=0 y= -8 +4 = -4 ≠0. Not. Perhaps the curve is y^2 = a x +8 x^3 or complicated. From solution: a = -4, and tip says dy/dx = x/4 + something? Wait, tip: dy/dx = 1 x +8? No. Tip: 'the equation of the tangent is y =2 x'. Point (4,2) lies on it. So y(4) =2, y'(4) = slope =2/4 =0.5? No, line y=2 x, slope 2. So y'(4) =2. y(4) =2. For y = a x^2 +8 x, a*16 +32 =2, 16 a = -30, a = -30/16 = -15/8. y' =2 a x +8, at 4: 8 a +8 =8 (-15/8) +8 = -15 +8 = -7 ≠2. Not. Perhaps y = a x + 8 ln x or something. Perhaps it's y = a x^2 + 8, constant. No. Let's look at solution text: At 4, y = a*4 +8*4? No. Text: At 4, y = a +8*4? No. Text: 2 1 At 4, 8 At 4, , 0. 8 and at 8 4 81So, 4 8 84 4xydy dx ax dyxdx a xy a yy amxx a a a a = + = = + = = + − + = = − + = + ⇒ + = = = − = Mark allocation. It seems OCR garbled, but from tip: when a=-4, dy/dx = x/4, at x=4, dy/dx =1, but tip says 1, for 4 2 dy x dx = , wait, '1, for 4 2 dy x dx = = , so the equation of the tangent is y =2 x'. dy/dx = x/2 ? At x=4, dy/dx =2. Yes, and point (4,2), y=2*4 =8? No, if y=2 x is tangent, at x=4, y=8, but tip says (4,2) lies on it? Tip: 'the point on the curve (4, 2) lies on this tangent'. So point (4,2), tangent y=2 x, but 2*4 =8 ≠2, contradiction. Perhaps y = (1/2) x. Slope 1/2, at x=4, y=2, yes, (1/2)*4 =2, yes. So slope =1/2. So y'(4) =1/2, y(4) =2. Now, assume form y = a x^2 + b x. But to have tangent pass origin, the tangent line has slope y'(4), intercept 0, so y = y'(4) x. Then the point (4, y(4)) must satisfy y(4) = y'(4) *4. So y(4) = 4 y'(4). That is the condition. For y = a x^2 + 8 x, y(4) =16 a +32, y'(x) =2 a x +8, y'(4) =8 a +8, 16 a +32 =4 (8 a +8) =32 a +32, 16 a =32 a, a=0. Still. So the 8 x is not. Perhaps the curve is y^2 = a x +8 x^3 or implicit. From solution text: Let X be? No, for Q10. Text: 21 2101 2 1At 4, 8 At 4, , 0. 8 and at 8 4 81So, 4 8 84 4xydy dx ax dyxdx a xy a yy amxx a a a a = + = = + = = + − + = = − + = + ⇒ + = = = − = Perhaps y = a x^2 + 1/x or something. Let's try y = a x + 8 / x. Earlier not. y(4) =4 a +8/4 =4 a +2 =2, wait, if point y(4)=2, then 4 a +2 =2, a=0, again. Perhaps the 8 is not coefficient. Perhaps the curve is y = a x^2, but. To match a=-4, and tip: substitute a = -4 into the equation dy/dx = x/4. So y' = x/4, integrate y = (1/8) x^2 + c, but passes? Perhaps the form is y' = a x + b, but to have a=-4. Perhaps it's the tangent at x=a passes through origin, but text says at x=4. The text is 'The tangent to the graph y = a x^2 + 8 x at x = 4 passes through the origin.' But as calculated, only a=0 works, but solution has a=-4, so likely OCR error in the PDF text for the equation of the curve. Likely the curve is y = a x^2 + 8 / x or y = a / x + 8 x. Let's try y = a / x + 8 x. y(4) = a/4 +32. y' = - a / x^2 +8. y'(4) = - a/16 +8. The tangent: y - y(4) = y'(4) (x -4). Set x=0, y=0: 0 - (a/4 +32) = y'(4) (0 -4). - a/4 -32 = -4 ( - a/16 +8 ). - a/4 -32 = 4 a/16 -32. - a/4 -32 = a/4 -32. - a/4 = a/4, - a/2 =0, a=0. Still. Perhaps y = a x^2 + 8 ln x. y' = 2 a x +8/x. y(4) =16 a +8 ln4. Tangent: y - y(4) = y'(4) (x -4). At x=0 difficult. Perhaps it's not ln. Perhaps the 8 is the constant or something. Perhaps the equation is y^2 = a x + 8 x^3, implicit differentiation 2 y y' = a + 24 x^2, y' = (a +24 x^2)/ (2 y). At x=4, y = sqrt(a*4 +8*64) = sqrt(4 a +512). Slope = (a +24*16)/ (2 y) = (a +384)/ (2 y). Tangent passes origin, but complicated. Perhaps accept a = -4 as per solution, and the detailed is as in solution: set the gradient equal to the derivative at x = a, but text is at x=4. The solution text has At 4, dy/dx = a +8/4 or something. The text has dy dx ax = , so y' = a x. Then y = (a/2) x^2 + c, but to pass origin? Perhaps the curve is parametric or something. Perhaps it's y = a x^2 + 8, constant. No. To move on, use the solution's logical step: 1 method mark for finding dy/dx = a x + something, but accept a=-4.",
