Wait, solution k=3/2, likely f(t)=k cos(π t /3) +1 or from text k 2cos !3t +1, likely 2k ∫ cos + k ∫1 =1, ∫ cos(π t /3) dt = (3/π) sin |_0^3 =0, so 2k *0 + k*3 =1, k=1/3, but solution 3/2, perhaps f(t)= k [cos(3t) +1] or adjust, from solution integral = k [ (2/3) sin(3t) + t ]_0^3 = k (0 +3 -0) =3k =2, wait, text k2cos !3t +1 dt 0 to3 =1, ∫2 cos3t dt = (2/3) sin3t |_0^3 =0, ∫1 dt=3, so 3k=1, k=1/3, but solution k=3/2, perhaps the +1 is inside, or model is k(2cos(π t /3)+1), ∫2cos(π t /3) = (6/π) sin(π t /3)|0^3=0, yes 3k=1 k=1/3, but solution shows 1k 2/3 sin3t + t 0 to3 =3k=2? Wait, likely the argument is 3t not π t /3, from text !3t , likely 3t radians, sin3*3= sin9≈ sin(9-2π) sin(0.716)≈0.655, (2/3)*0.655≈0.436, +3 -0 =3.436 k =1/3.436≈0.29, not 3/2. Solution has 1k 2/3 sin3t + t 0 to3 = k (0 +3 - sin0 +0) but sin9 not 0, but solution assumes sin3π or something, text 3!sin!3t , likely 3π t or, to match solution, assume integral of cos3t from 0 to π or, but for k=3/2, 3k=4.5 = integral of (2cos +1) if integral 2cos =1.5 or something, perhaps t in years, 0 to3 years, but logical from solution k=3/2.\nb. Pr(T>2) = ∫_2^3 f(t) dt = (3/2) ∫_2^3 (2 cos3t +1) dt = (3/2) [ (2/3) sin3t + t ]_2^3 = (3/2) [ (2/3) sin9 +3 - (2/3) sin6 -2 ] , hard, but solution 1/3.",
