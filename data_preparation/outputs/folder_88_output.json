If g(x)=x, then the point (x, x) is on g, and since g^{-1}(x) = g^{-1}(g(x)) =x, so (x, g^{-1}(x))=(x,x), yes on y=x.\nBut are there other intersections off y=x? Yes, if g(p)=q, g(q)=p with p≠q, then the point (p,q) is on g, and since g^{-1}(q)=p, wait, the graph of g^{-1} at x=q is g^{-1}(q)=p, so point (q,p) on g^{-1}.\nSo the intersection of graphs would require a point that is on both, i.e. a point (r,s) such that s = g(r) and s = g^{-1}(r), so g(r) = g^{-1}(r).\nLet z = g(r) = g^{-1}(r), then r = g(z), since g^{-1}(r) = z implies g(z)=r.\nSo z = g(r), r = g(z).\nSo same as before.\nTo have intersection, there exists r such that g( g(r) ) = r? No, from z = g(r), r = g(z), so g(g(r)) = g(z) = r, yes, so fixed points of g², the 2-cycles or fixed points.\nSo no intersection if no solutions to g(g(x)) = x.\nBut that might be complicated.\nThe report says: some students tried to algebraically find the point of intersection of the graphs of function and its inverse function , with limited progress . This question could also be solved by consideration of the point where the gradient of g(x) was equal to the gradient of y = x.\nSo, since the inverse graph is reflection over y=x, the places where they can intersect off y=x would require the slopes to match in some way, but for no intersection, when g(x) > x for all x or something.\nSince g'(x) = ln x +1, set g'(x) =1, ln x +1 =1, ln x =0, x=1.\nAt x=1, g(1) =1 ln1 +k =k.\nIf k >1, then at the point where slope=1, g(1)=k >1, and since minimum of g is at x=1/e, g(1/e)= -1/e +k, but to determine if crosses y=x.\nThe fixed points solve g(x)=x, x ln x +k =x, k = x - x ln x = x (1 - ln x).\nThe function h(x) = x (1 - ln x), domain x>0, h'(x) =1 - ln x - x (1/x) = - ln x, critical at x=1, h(1)=0.\nFor x<1, ln x <0, 1 - ln x >1, h(x)>0 for x≠1?

Wait, 1 - ln x at x= sqrt(e), ln sqrt(e) =0.5, 1-0.5=0.5, h= sqrt(e) *0.5 >0? Wait.\n h(x) = x - x ln x.\n h'(x) =1 - (ln x + x *1/x ) =1 - ln x -1 = - ln x.\nYes.\nAt x= sqrt(e) ≈1.648, ln x =0.5, h'(x) = -0.5 <0, h(x) =1.648 * (1 -0.5) =1.648*0.5 ≈0.824 >0.\nBut if h(1)=0, h'(x)<0 for x>1, how can h increase? No, h'(x) = - ln x, at x=1+, ln x =0+, -0+ <0, decreasing, but to have h(e)=0, but if decreasing from 0 to negative, but calculation h(sqrt(e)) >0? Wait, sqrt(e)≈1.648, ln1.648≈0.5, 1-0.5=0.5, 1.648*0.5≈0.824 >0.\n h(e) = e - e *1 =0.\nSo from x=1 to e, h decreases from 0 to some min then back to 0? No, h' = - ln x <0 for x>1, so decreasing, but 0 to 0.824? No, wait, h(1)=1*(1-0)=1? Wait, ln1 =0, 1 -0 =1, h(1)=1*1 =1, not 0.\n Mistake!\n g(x) = x ln x +k =x, k = x - x ln x = x (1 - ln x).\nYes, h(x) = x (1 - ln x).\nAt x=1, ln1=0, 1-0=1, h(1)=1*1=1 ≠0.\nYes, error earlier.\nAt x=e, ln e=1, 1-1=0, h(e)=0.\nAs x->0+, ln x -> -∞, 1 - ln x -> ∞, x * ∞ ->0 actually, since x ln x ->0, - x ln x ->0, x*1 ->0.\nAs x->∞, ln x ->∞, 1 - ln x -> -∞, x * -∞ -> -∞.\n h'(x) = - ln x, critical at x=1, h''(x) = -1/x <0, maximum at x=1, h(1)=1.\nFor fixed points, k = h(x) for some x, so the range of h is (-∞,1], since max 1, goes to -∞ and to 0 from left.\nFor 0<x<1, h'(x) = - ln x >0 since ln x <0, so increasing from 0 to 1 at x=1.\nFor x>1, h'<0, decreasing from 1 to -∞.\nSo h(x) takes [0,1] for x in (0,1], and [ -∞ ,1] for x>1, overall range (-∞,1].\nSo for k >1, no solution to g(x)=x, meaning no fixed points.\nBut for intersection of g and g^{-1}, as they always intersect at fixed points if exist, but if no fixed points, may still intersect at 2-cycles.\nBut the report suggests k>1 for no intersection, so probably for k>1, no intersection at all, meaning no 2-cycles either.\nLikely when k>1, g(x) > x for all x or something, so the graph is entirely above y=x, and the inverse would be below or something, no intersection.\nYes, since max of x - g(x) = -k + x (1 - ln x), wait, g(x) - x = x ln x + k - x = k + x (ln x -1).\nTo see if g(x) > x for all x when k>1.\nThe min of g(x) - x = k + min of x (ln x -1).\nLet m(x) = x (ln x -1), m'(x) = ln x -1 + x (1/x) = ln x , critical at x=1, m(1)=1(0-1)=-1.\n m(x) ->0 as x->0+, m(x)->∞ as x->∞.\nSo min of m(x) = -1 at x=1.\nSo g(x) - x = k + m(x) ≥ k -1.\nIf k >1, k-1 >0, so g(x) > x for all x, meaning the graph of g is entirely above y=x.\nNow, for the inverse g^{-1}, since g is increasing (g'>0 for x>1/e), and g(1/e)= -1/e +k > -1/e +1 >0, and since g(x)>x for all, the inverse will satisfy g^{-1}(y) < y for all y in range, meaning the graph of g^{-1} is below y=x.\nTherefore, g above y=x, g^{-1} below y=x, so they don't cross each other.\nYes, hence no intersection when k>1.\nFor k=1, touches at x=1, g(1)=1.\nFor k<1, crosses y=x.\nPerfect.",
