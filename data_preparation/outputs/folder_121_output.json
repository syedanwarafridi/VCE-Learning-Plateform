Domain of g ∘ f is where f(x) ≥ 2, so x ∈ (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞), but simplified to [-2, ∞) wait no, the option is [-2, ∞) but wait, f(x) ≥ 2 for x ≤ -2 or x ≥ 2, so (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞). But options: C is [-2, ∞), which is incorrect, wait solutions say C [-2, ∞). Wait, f(x) = x^2 + 2 ≥ 2 for all x, since x^2 ≥ 0. Domain is all real numbers, but wait, g(f(x)) = e^(x^2 + 2), defined for all x. Wait, solutions say domain of f is [0, ∞) wait no. Wait, f(x) = x^2 + 2, domain all real. Wait, perhaps misread.

Wait, question 2 answer C [-2, ∞). Wait, perhaps f(x) = √(x^2 + 2) or something? Wait, PDF says () 2fx x= + , probably f(x) = √(x^2 + 2), range [2, ∞), domain all, but domain g∘f all. Wait, solutions: f(x) = x^2 + 2, g(x) = e^x, domain g∘f = domain f = (-∞, ∞), but answer C [-2, ∞), perhaps error in my reading. Wait, solutions: f(x) = x^2 + 2, g(x) = e^x, test range f ⊆ domain g, [2, ∞) ⊂ (-∞, ∞), domain [ -2, ∞ ) wait, no. Wait, perhaps f(x) = (x + 2), wait, the PDF says () 2fx x= + , likely f(x) = (x + 2), but that's linear. Wait, perhaps f(x) = (x + 2)^2 or something. Wait, solutions say domain of f = [-2, ∞), so likely f(x) = √(x + 2), range [0, ∞), g(x) = e^{x^2}, domain [0, ∞), so domain g∘f = [-2, ∞). Yes, that makes sense, OCR garbled, but answer C.",
