Wait, report uses the values. Actually, logical: Assume consistent. But per text, calculate as ∫_0^1 f = 3, from 2∫_0^1 f =5 implies inconsistency, perhaps separate. Per report, brackets missing common. Logical: The sum is ∫_0^2 f(x) dx = ∫_0^1 f + ∫_1^2 f. But to find, perhaps from other. Wait, the text has garbled, but report says not well answered, some expanded as product. Logical estimate: From given, if ∫_0^1 f =3, and if 2∫_0^1 f =6 but said 5, perhaps OCR. Assume values as is, but to evaluate sum, need ∫_1^2. The text has ∫_0^1 2f =5, so ∫_0^1 f =5/2, but then says ∫_0^1 f =3, likely OCR error, use report logic. Report: some substituted 1/3 for f(x), but logical: The question is to evaluate ∫_0^1 f(x) dx + ∫_1^2 f(x) dx, with given ∫_0^1 2 f(x) dx =5, so ∫_0^1 f =5/2, and another given ∫_0^1 f(x) dx =3, but that can't be. Likely the second is ∫_1^2 f(x) dx =3. Yes, OCR garbled. So ∫_0^1 f =5/2, ∫_1^2 f =3, sum =5/2 +3 =11/2. But report average 1.5/3, perhaps. Wait, to match, but for answer, the final is the sum.",

Logical: the area under curve from 0 to 20 is ∫ a sin(π x /20) dx = [ - (20a/π) cos(π x /20) ]_0^{20} = - (20a/π) (1 -1) =0, but that's net area, but for painting, perhaps absolute or the curve divides the tile into two regions of equal area.

The division is the curve y=f(x), and colors above and below, but since ends at 0, and tile square, the area above curve and below = half if the net is 0 and symmetric, so any a, but to meet condition, perhaps specific for matching.
