But that is the area between from π/4 to 5π/4, but the interval length is π, average height about 1.27, area about 4, but 4 √2 ≈5.65, possible, but solutions have (1 mark) for correct terminals, (1 mark) for correct integrand, so likely the area is 2 √2 , if without the 2, but f =2 sin, g=2 cos, so |2 sin -2 cos | =2 |sin - cos |, so area =2 * 2 √2 =4 √2 ? Wait, no, the integral of (sin - cos ) is 2 √2 , so 2 * 2 √2 =4 √2 ? No, ∫ 2 (sin - cos ) dx =2 * ( - cos - sin ) =2 * 2 √2 =4 √2 .\nBut the text has 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 sin4 cos45 sin45 cos2 ) sin(2 ) cos(2 ) ) cos(2 ) sin(2 ( ) ( ( , which seems to use double angle for area = ∫ 1/2 | sin 2x | or something, but the final calculation is π +π - = − = − = π π π π ∫ ∫ x dx x x g x f , but the number is 2 (π/2 -1 ) or something.\nWait, perhaps the shaded is not the entire between, but from the graph, the shaded is the region between the curves from 0 to 3π/2, but only certain parts.\nThe text has S TA C x O y 4 π 2 π 2 3 π 4 5 π ) ( x g y = ) ( x f y = , so intersections at π/4, 5π/4, and perhaps shaded is between π/4 to π/2 or specific region.\nThe calculation has 4 5 4 4 5 4 4 π + π − π + π − , which is (5π/4 - π/4 ) + (π/4 -5π/4 ) no, but the integral from π/4 to 5π/4 of (cos x - sin x ) would be negative, but absolute.\nPerhaps the shaded is the area where f > g or specific, and the final is 2 (√2 -1 ) or something, but to estimate, the text has 21 21 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 , which is 1/√2 = √2/2 ≈0.707, 2*0.707 =1.414, then 2 (1 -0.707) or something.\nThe text has 21 21 21 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 sin 4 cos 4 5 sin 4 5 cos , sin4 5π = sin 225° = -√2/2, cos5π/4 = -√2/2, sinπ/4 =√2/2, cosπ/4 =√2/2.\nSo 2 ( cos5π/4 - sin5π/4 ) - 2 ( cosπ/4 - sinπ/4 ) =2 ( -√2/2 - ( -√2/2 ) ) -2 ( √2/2 - √2/2 ) =2 ( -√2/2 +√2/2 ) -2 (0 ) =0, that can't be.\nPerhaps it's ∫ 2 cos - 2 sin =2 [ sin - (- cos ) ] =2 [ sin + cos ] , as I had earlier, leading to 2 [ -√2 - √2 ] = -4 √2 , absolute 4 √2 , but that is the signed, but for area, if the order is sin - cos in some parts.\nPerhaps the shaded region is from 0 to π/4 and 5π/4 to 3π/2 or something, but the text has the integral from π/4 to 5π/4 , and then the calculation is the double angle way: the area = ∫_{π/4}^{5π/4} |2 sin x -2 cos x| dx =2 ∫ | sin x - cos x | dx =2 ∫ √2 | sin (x - π/4 ) | dx .\nLet u = x - π/4 , from 0 to π , ∫_0^π √2 | sin u | du *2 / √2 wait, 2 * √2 ∫_0^π | sin u | du = 2 √2 * 2 = 4 √2 , yes.\nBut the text has a different expression, perhaps it's that, but then the final is 4 √2 - something? No, the text has 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 sin 4 cos 4 5 sin 4 5 cos , perhaps it's 1/2 ∫ sin 2x dx or something.\n sin 2x = 2 sin cos , so | sin x - cos x | = √2 | sin (x -π/4 ) | , yes, integral over π length is √2 * 2 *2 = wait, ∫_0^π | sin u | du =2, so 2 * √2 * 2 =4 √2 , yes.\nBut the text has the value as π -1 ? No, the text has the area shaded 4 5 4 4 5 4 4 π + π − π + π − = − = − = π π π π ∫ ∫ x dx x x g x f , so it seems the integral is from π/4 to 5π/4 of (g - f ) dx , but since it's negative, they took absolute or the shaded is the other way.\nPerhaps the shaded is the area between from 0 to π/4 where g > f, and from 5π/4 to 3π/2 where f > g or something, let's calculate that.\nFrom 0 to π/4 , g =2 cos x >2 sin x =f , area ∫_0^{π/4} 2 (cos x - sin x ) dx =2 [ sin x + cos x ]_0^{π/4} =2 [ (√2/2 + √2/2 ) - (0 +1 ) ] =2 [ √2 -1 ] .\nFrom 5π/4 to 3π/2 , at 5π/4 , sin 5π/4 = -√2/2 , cos = -√2/2 , but since 2 sin , 2 cos , but in [0,3π/2 ], sin is positive until π , negative after, but cos positive to π/2 , negative after.\nAt 3π/2 , sin 3π/2 = -1 , cos =0 , so 2 sin = -2 , 2 cos =0 , but graphs of sin and cos are usually considered, but since domain [0,3π/2 ], and graphs shown, likely the shaded is the regions where they cross, but to match the terminals in solutions, the text has for correct terminals of integration , so likely the main area is from π/4 to 5π/4 , and the area is 4 √2 , but that is approximately 5.656, but perhaps not.\nWait, perhaps the factor is not 2, but the integral of |sin x - cos x | is √2 ∫ | sin (x -π/4 ) | dx from π/4 to 5π/4 = √2 ∫_0^π | sin u | du = √2 * 2 = 2 √2 , then for 2 |sin - cos | , 2 * 2 √2 =4 √2 ? No, |2 sin -2 cos | =2 |sin - cos | =2 √2 | sin (x -π/4 ) | , so integral 2 √2 ∫_0^π | sin u | du =2 √2 *2 =4 √2 .\nYes, and the text has (1 mark) for correct terminals, (1 mark) for correct integrand, so likely the answer is 4 √2 .\nBut the text has the calculation leading to 2 1 2 1 , but perhaps the final is 2 √2 , if they forgot the 2.\nWait, if f = sin x , g = cos x , then |sin - cos | integral 2 √2 , but the problem has 2 sin , 2 cos , so 4 √2 .\nBut to resolve, since the text has the area as 2 (1 - sin4 cos4 etc , but perhaps the answer is 2 √2 .\nLooking at the text: the area shaded 4 5 4 4 5 4 4 π + π − = − = π π ∫ x dx x g x f , so they have ∫ g - f , but to get positive, perhaps they did f - g where f > g.\nAnd the value is the difference at bounds π/4 and 5π/4 of - cos - sin , as I had 2 * 2 √2 =4 √2 , but the 2 is for the coefficient.\nYes, so the area is 4 √2 .\nBut the text has 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 sin 4 cos 45 sin 45 cos , perhaps it's 2 [ cos x - sin x ] or something, but if 2 [ - sin x - cos x ] no.\nPerhaps the integrand is 2 cos x - 2 sin x =2 (cos - sin ), integral 2 [ sin + cos ] from π/4 to 5π/4 =2 ( -√2 - (√2 ) ) =2 ( -2 √2 ) = -4 √2 , absolute 4 √2 .\nYes, so the final answer is 4 √2 .\nBut the text has a different expression, perhaps they used the double angle: the area = ∫ 1/2 *4 sin^2 or something, but anyway, logically the area is 4 √2 .",
