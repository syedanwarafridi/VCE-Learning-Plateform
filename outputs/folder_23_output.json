From solutions: log_e 2 + log_e (x - 1) = log_e (2(x - 1)), but equation is log_e 2 + log_e (x - 1) = 2 log_e x.

Wait, looking closely: )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , so left is 2 log_e 2, right is log_e (x - 1) + log_e (x - 2)? No, the equation is 2 log_e 2 = log_e (x - 1) + log_e (x - 2), no. The text is )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , so log_e (x - 2) + log_e (x - 1) = 2 log_e 2, so log_e [(x - 2)(x - 1)] = log_e 4, (x - 2)(x - 1) = 4, x^2 - 3x + 2 = 4, x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0, x = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 8)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(17)]/2.

Wait, let's calculate from solutions text: )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , so left log_e x^2, right log_e (x - 1) + log_e 2 - log_e (x - 2), = log_e [2 (x - 1)/(x - 2)], so x^2 = 2 (x - 1)/(x - 2), x^2 (x - 2) = 2 (x - 1), x^3 - 2x^2 = 2x - 2, x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0, but solutions have 2 log_e x = log_e (x - 1) + log_e 2 - log_e (x - 2), yes. From solutions: )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , so 2 log_e x = log_e (x - 1) + log_e 2 - log_e (x - 2), yes.

From solutions: )2(log1)2(log2 e exx=    +− , wait, it's log_e (x^2) = log_e 2 + log_e (x - 1) - log_e (x - 2) = log_e [2 (x - 1)/(x - 2)], same. Then 21)2(2 =+− xx , wait, that seems like they simplified differently. Perhaps it's log_e 2 + log_e (x - 1) - log_e (x - 2) = log_e x^2, yes. Then from solutions: 21)2(2 =+− xx , perhaps they wrote it as log_e (x^2 (x - 2)) = log_e [2 (x - 1)], x^2 (x - 2) = 2 (x - 1). Then to solve, perhaps they used quadratic by assuming or something.

From x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0, perhaps factor as (x - 1)(x^2 - x - 2) or something? Wait, let's solve x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Possible rational root 1,2,-1,-2. x=1: 1 - 2 - 2 + 2 = -1 ≠0. x=-1: -1 - 2 +2 +2 =1 ≠0. x=2: 8 - 8 -4 +2 = -2 ≠0. x=-2: -8 - 8 +4 +2 = -10 ≠0. No rational roots. From solutions, it seems they have 2x + 2 = 2(x + 1), wait, the equation is 2 log_e x = log_e (x - 1) + log_e 2 - log_e (x - 2), yes. Perhaps the equation is log_e (x - 2) + log_e (x - 1) = 2 log_e 2, but the text has )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , the −− is - log_e (x - 2), yes. To match solutions, the calculation in solutions is 21)2(2 =+− xx , which is 2 = (x + 1)/(x - 2) * 2? Wait, perhaps misOCR. The solutions have )2(log)1(log)2(log2e e e x x =+−− , perhaps it's 2 log_e (x - 2) = log_e (x - 1) + log_e 2, but that doesn't match.

Then x^2 = 2 (x - 1)/(x - 2). Then multiply both sides by (x - 2): x^2 (x - 2) = 2 (x - 1). Expand: x^3 - 2x^2 = 2x - 2. Bring to left: x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Now, to solve, perhaps they did synthetic or something. From solutions: 21)2(2 =+− xx , that seems like 2 = 2 (x + 1)/(x - 2), so 1 = (x + 1)/(x - 2), x - 2 = x + 1, -2 = 1, impossible. Wait, perhaps the left is log_e (x^2) = log_e 2 + log_e (x + 1) - log_e (x - 2) or something. The text is )1(log, so x - 1. Perhaps OCR error in solutions, the )1( is )+1( or something.
