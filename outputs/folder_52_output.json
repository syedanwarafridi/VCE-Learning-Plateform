No, the text is 10 log (2 ) e A B = − (1) , so -10 log2 = A - B? The OCR is garbled.\nThe calculation: divide (2) by (1): log8 / log2 =2 = [20 log e (8 ) wait, no.\nLater: (log 8 / log 2 ) e B - e B = - , wait, it's OCR garbled, but the final is B=1 or 4, but then substitute B=-1 into (1) 10 log_e 3 = A?

No.\nThe text is 10 log (2 ) e A B = − , perhaps it's -10 = A log_e 2 - B, meaning the y values are -10 and -20, but question has 10 and 20.\nAssume the equation is y = A log_e x + B, but to match the solution's final A and B, and the calculation leads to B= -1 or 4, and chooses B=-1, then 10 log_e 2 = -A + B, but that doesn't make sense.\nFrom the calculation: after divide, 2 = log8 / log2 = (20 log? No.\nThe text: ()() log 8 2 log 2 e e B B − = − , so log8 - 2 log2 =0 = log (8/4) = log2 =0, not.\nIt's garbled, but the final is B=1,4, but chooses B=-1? Text: 1, 4 as 2 B B B = − ≠ < 1 A , garbled.\nLater substitute 1 B = − into (1) 10 log (3 ) e A = 1 A , so the (1) is 10 = A log_e 3 + B or something.\nPerhaps the points are (3,10) and (9,20), but 9 = e^{log9}, but to fit, assume the solution has A =10 / log_e 3, B = -1, but for the question as written, I'll calculate the correct for (2,10) (8,20).\nCorrect calculation for question as written: y = A log_e x - B\n10 = A log_e 2 - B\n20 = A log_e 8 - B\nSubtract: 10 = A (log_e 8 - log_e 2) = A log_e 4 = A * 2 log_e 2 ≈ A *1.386\nA =10 /1.386 ≈7.213\nB = A log_e 2 -10 ≈7.213 *0.693 -10 ≈5 -10 = -5\nSo A ≈7.21, B = -5, but since real numbers, but to exact: A = 5 / log_e 2, B = -5\nSince log4 =2 log2, A =10 / log4 =10 / (2 log2) =5 / log2 = 5 log_2 e\nB = (5 log_2 e ) log_e 2 -10 =5 *1 -10 = -5\nYes, so answer is A = 5 log_2 e, B =5, but the - B, so B=5, since - (-5)? No, y = A log x - B, with B = -5? No, B is the constant in -B, but the value is the number.\nThe question says A and B real constants, so A = 5 / log_e 2, B = -5 + A log_e 2 = wait, from above B = A log2 -10, but since A log2 = (5 / log2 ) log2 =5, B =5 -10 = -5\nSo the values are A = 5 / log_e 2, B = -5\nBut the solutions have different, perhaps the equation is y = A log_e x + B, then B would be the constant.\nFor y = A log_e x + B, 10 = A log2 + B, 20 = A *3 log2 + B, subtract 10 = A *2 log2, A =5 / log2, B =10 - (5 / log2 ) log2 =10 -5 =5\nYes, and the solutions have log (8 ) =3 log2, yes, and the calculation has divide (2)/(1): 20 /10 =2 = log8 / log2 =3? No, 20/10=2, but log8/log2=3, not matching.\nThe text is 20 log (8 ) e A B = − , no.\nPerhaps the points are (2,10) and (4,20), since log4 / log2 =2, then 10 = A log2 - B, 20 = A log4 - B = A *2 log2 - B, subtract 10 = A log2, A =10 / log2, B =10 - (10 / log2 ) log2 =0, not.\nPerhaps the y = - A log_e x + B, to have negative A.\nAssume y = - A log_e x + B, with A positive.\n10 = - A log2 + B, 20 = - A *3 log2 + B, subtract 10 = - A *2 log2, A =10 / (2 log2) =5 / log2, then B =10 + (5 / log2 ) log2 =10 +5 =15\nBut solutions have A=-10, B=1, not matching.\nThe calculation in solutions leads to 2 B - B = -4 B or something, the text: (2 log 2 - log 8 ) e B - e B = - , log8 =3 log2, 2 log2 -3 log2 = - log2 = ( B - B ) e ? Garbled.\nLater: 2 2 8 B B − = − , 4 B = 8 B - 4 or something.\nThe text: ()()2 log 2 log 8 e e B B − = − ()()2 log 2 log 8 e e B B − = − , same.\nThen ()()2 log 2 log 8 e B B − = − , then 2 2 8 B B − = − , perhaps 2^2 8 B B − = − , no.\nThen 2 4 4 8 B B B − + = − , perhaps the ratio is log (8/2) = log4 =2 log2, but it's hard.\nTo resolve, since the task is to extract from PDF, and the question text is clear, I'll go with the literal question and compute the values accordingly.\nSo A = 5 / log_e 2, B = -5, but to write exactly, A = 10 / log_e 4, but better A = 5 log_2 e, B = -5",

The parabola y' = 2 m x +2 , at m=-1 , y' = -2 x +2 , at x=-1 , -2*(-1 ) +2 =2 +2 =4 , so the line gradient is 4 , so y =4 x + b .\nSo the line has gradient 4 when m=-1 .\nSo for the line, the gradient is not 1, so the equation must be different.\nLet's reverse engineer the equation to have gradient 4 when m=-1 .\nFrom the solution, for m=-1 , the line is y =4 x + b , but the text has 45 y x = − , perhaps OCR garbled, 4 5 y x = − is 4 x -5 or something, no.\nThe 45 y x = − is y = -4 x /5 or , no.\nPerhaps it's y =4 x -5 , and the OCR read 4 5 y x = − as 45 y x = − , but the - is for the constant.\nAssume the line is y =4 x -5 , then set to parabola - x^2 +2 x -6 =4 x -5 , - x^2 +2 x -6 -4 x +5 =0 , - x^2 -2 x -1 =0 , x^2 +2 x +1 =0 , (x+1 )^2 =0 , x=-1 double root, yes tangent.\nYes, that matches the solution text: 2 2 1 0 x x + + = , yes x^2 +2 x +1 =0 , and only one unique solution, hence tangent.\nSo the line for m=-1 is y =4 x -5 , so how is the equation leading to that?\nFor m=-1 , the line equation leads to y =4 x -5 .\nSo let's find what the coefficient is.\nAssume the equation is a x + m y = c , with a = -2 m -1 or something.\nFor m=-1 , suppose a x - y = d , then y = a x - d , to have a =4 , d =5 , y =4 x -5 .\nSo for m=-1 , the coefficient of x is such that the gradient is 4.\nFrom general, the line: a x + m y = rhs , y = - (a / m ) x + rhs / m , gradient = - a / m\nFor unique solution, the condition is when gradient1 = gradient2 , i.e. - a / m = m /3 , since second gradient m /3 .\nSo - a / m = m /3 , a = - ( m^2 /3 ) \nBut a = -2 m -1 , so -2 m -1 = - ( m^2 /3 ) , 2 m +1 = m^2 /3 , m^2 -6 m -3 =0 , same as before.\nBut for m=-1 , gradient1 = - a / m = - ( -2*(-1 ) -1 ) / (-1 ) = - (2 -1 ) / -1 = - (1 ) / -1 = - (-1 ) =1 , as before.\nBut to have 4 , the a must be such that - a / m =4 , for m=-1 , - a / -1 =4 , a = -4\nSo the coefficient of x is a = -4 when m=-1 , but from -2 m -1 = -2*(-1 ) -1 =2 -1 =1 , not -4 .\nPerhaps the equation is (2 m -1 ) x + m y = m +4 or something.\nLet me try to find the form that fits.\nAssume the coefficient of x is 2 m -1 , then for m=-1 ,  -2 -1 = -3 , then gradient - (2 m -1 ) / m , for m=-1 , - ( -3 ) / -1 = -3 / -1 =3 , not 4.\nPerhaps ( m -2 ) x + m y = something.\nPerhaps the first equation is (2 m +1 ) x + m y = m +4 , then for m=-1 , ( -2 +1 ) x - y = -1 +4 =3 , - x - y =3 , y = - x -3 , gradient -1 , not.\nPerhaps the parenthesis is ( -2 ( m -1 ) ) x + m y = - m +4 , for m=-1 , -2 ( -1 -1 ) x - y =1 +4 =5 , -2 ( -2 ) x - y =5 , 4 x - y =5 , y =4 x -5 , yes!

No, perhaps miscalculation, but the final is 3/4 .\nAnyway, the probability is 3/4 .\nc. Pr(at least one goal in n shots ) >0.9 , 1 - (0.8)^n >0.9 , (0.8)^n <0.1 , n log 0.8 < log 0.1 , since log 0.8 <0 , divide reverse: n > log 0.1 / log 0.8\nlog10 0.1 = -1 , log10 0.8 ≈ log10 (4/5 ) = log4 - log5 ≈0.602 -0.699 = -0.097 , so n > 1 / 0.097 ≈10.3 , so n=11\nGiven log10 8 ≈0.903 , note 0.8 = 8/10 , log 0.8 = log8 -1 ≈0.903 -1 = -0.097 , yes.",
