Wait, f(x)=k x, ∫ k x dx = k/2 (16-1)=15k/2=1, k=2/15, but solutions have k=3/14 for f(x)=k / x ? Wait, PDF says f(x)=kx, but solutions treat as k/x or something. Looking at solutions: f(x)=k x for 1≤x≤4?

Wait, looking closely at PDF: f(x)=kx1≤x≤4, but the way it's written f(x)=kx with 1≤x≤4, but perhaps it's f(x)=k x, but solutions have ∫ k x dx = k/2 (16-1)=15k/2=1, k=2/15, but solutions text has k=3/14, wait, solutions: 4 1 k x dx = k [x^2/2]_1^4 = k/2 (16-1)=15k/2=1, k=2/15, but then later k=3/14?

Wait, solutions have k x dx, but then k [x^2/2], but then says k=3/14, perhaps f(x)=k x^2 or something. Wait, to match, let's compute for E(X). For b, E(X)= ∫ x f(x) dx = ∫_1^4 k x^2 dx = k [x^3/3]_1^4 = k/3 (64-1)=63k/3=21 k, if k=3/14, 21*3/14=63/14=4.5, but solutions have 32/15≈2.133, wait, solutions have E(X)=32/15. For f(x)=k x, k=2/15, E(X)= ∫ k x^2 dx = (2/15) [x^3/3]_1^4 = (2/15)(1/3)(64-1)= (2/15)(21)=42/15=2.8, not 32/15. Wait, 32/15≈2.133. Let's solve for what f is. For PDF f(x)=kx, but perhaps it's f(x)=k x, but to match k=3/14, let's see the integral for normalization. If ∫_1^4 k x dx = k/2 (16-1)=15k/2=1, k=2/15. For E(X)= ∫_1^4 x * k x dx = k ∫ x^2 dx = k [x^3/3]_1^4 = k/3 (64-1)=21 k =21*(2/15)=42/15=14/5=2.8. But solutions have 32/15, so perhaps f(x)=k / x. If f(x)=k / x, ∫_1^4 k / x dx = k ln4 = k * ln(4) = k * 2 ln2 ≈ k *1.386 =1, k≈0.721. E(X)= ∫_1^4 x * (k / x) dx = ∫_1^4 k dx = k [x]_1^4 = k*3 =0.721*3≈2.163, close to 32/15=2.133, but ln4= ln(4)=1.386294, 1/1.386≈0.721, 0.721*3≈2.163, but 32/15=2.133, not exact. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, solutions have k=3/14, 3/14≈0.214, if f(x)=k x^2, ∫ k x^2 dx = k/3 (64-1)=21 k=1, k=1/21≈0.047, not. Wait, looking at solutions text: f(x)=k x for the integral k x dx, but then the calculation has 4 1 k x dx = k [x^2/2] = k/2 (16-1)=15k/2, but then it has ( )43 2 1 3 3 33 2 2 22, perhaps it's f(x)=k, constant? If f(x)=k for 1≤x≤4, then ∫ k dx = k*3=1, k=1/3, E(X)= ∫ x k dx = k [x^2/2]_1^4 = (1/3)(1/2)(16-1)= (1/3)(7.5)=2.5, not 32/15. Wait, solutions have k=3/14, E(X)=32/15. Let's compute what f is to match both. Suppose f(x)=k (x - a) or something, but perhaps OCR error in PDF, the PDF has f(x)=kx1≤x≤4, perhaps it's f(x)=k x, but solutions have different. Wait, looking at solutions: the integral is 4 1 k x dx = k [x^2 /2 ]_1^4 = k/2 (16 -1) =15k/2 =1, k=2/15. Then for E(X)= ∫_1^4 x * k x dx = k ∫ x^2 dx = k [x^3/3]_1^4 = k/3 (64-1)=21 k =21*(2/15)=42/15 =14/5 =2.8. But solutions have 32/14? Wait, solutions text has 32 14 5 3 (32 1)35 93 35 23 35, wait, garbled, but final E(X)=32/15. Perhaps f(x)=k / x^2 or something. Let's reverse engineer. For k=3/14, what f makes sense. Suppose f(x)=k x^0, no. Perhaps f(x)=k (4 - x) or something. Let's assume the PDF is correct, f(x)=k x, and the answer is k=2/15, E(X)=14/5, but since solutions have 3/14, perhaps the PDF OCR missed, perhaps f(x)=k, but no. Wait, looking at solutions: the text has f(x)=k x 1≤x≤4, but the calculation has k [x^2 /2 ] but then says k=3/14, which doesn't match, so likely OCR garble in solutions too. To resolve, I will use logical reconstruction. For standard problem, often f(x)=k / x for log uniform, but to match k=3/14, let's see if f(x)=k x^{-1/2} or something. ∫_1^4 k x^{-1/2} dx = k [2 x^{1/2}]_1^4 = 2k (2 -1)=2k =1, k=1/2, not. Perhaps f(x)=k (x^2), no. Wait, solutions have Note 4 4 8 3 2 (8 1) 13 14 3 3 14 , perhaps it's ∫ k / (4 - x) or something. Perhaps it's f(x)=k x for 0≤x≤4, but PDF says 1≤x≤4. To proceed, since rule 2 says if corrupted, don't use it, but to estimate logically, I will use the PDF text as is, f(x)=k x, k=2/15, E(X)=14/5.",

                    "detailed_answer": "a. Set f(x)=0, 3 = e^{kx}, kx = ln3, x = (1/k) ln3. b. Average = 1 / ((1/k) ln3 - 0) ∫_0^{(1/k)ln3} (3 - e^{kx}) dx = k / ln3 [3x - (1/k) e^{kx} ]_0^{(1/k)ln3} = k / ln3 [3*(1/k)ln3 - (1/k)*3 - (0 - 1/k)] = k / ln3 [ (3/k) ln3 - 3/k + 1/k ] = k / ln3 * (1/k) [3 ln3 - 3 + 1] = (3 ln3 - 2)/ ln3 = 3 - 2 / ln3, wait, to match a - b ln a, wait, solutions have 3 - (3/2) ln3 or something? From solutions: average = 3 - (3/2) ln3? Wait, calculation in solutions garbled, but final form a - b log_e (a), with a=3, b=3/2? But b integer, perhaps 6/2 - 3/2 ln3 =3 - (3/2) ln3, but to make b integer, multiply? Wait, solutions have 3 - 2 log_e 3, but log_e 3 = ln3, but 2 is integer. But from my calc it's 3 - 2/ln3, no. Wait, let's recalculate. ∫ (3 - e^{kx}) dx = 3x - (1/k) e^{kx}, from 0 to b where b=(1/k) ln3, at b: 3b - (1/k) e^{k b} = 3b - (1/k) *3, at 0: 0 - (1/k)*1 = -1/k, so integral = [3b - 3/k + 1/k ] = 3b - 2/k, average = 1/b * (3b - 2/k) = 3 - (2/k)/b = 3 - 2/(k b) , but k b = ln3, so 3 - 2 / ln3. But solutions have log_e (3), so perhaps the form is 3 - 2 log_e (e^{1/2}) or something, but no. Wait, 2 / ln3 = 2 log_e 3 / (ln3 * log_e 3) no. Note that 1 / ln3 = log_3 e, but not. Perhaps the form is with b=2, but 3 - 2 log_e (3^{1/2}) =3 - ln3, not. From solutions text: average =1 log (3) 0 ... =3 - (3/2) log_e 3 or something, the text has 3log (3) 3 1 1log (3) 0log (3) 3 3 1log (3) Note that 3.log (3) 32log (3)log (3) 23log (3), garbled, but final =3 - (3/2) ln3? But to fit a - b ln a, with a, b positive integers, perhaps a=3, b=3/2 not integer, perhaps express as 6/2 - (3/2) ln3 = (6 - 3 ln3)/2, but not. Perhaps the average is 2 - ln3 or something. Let's compute numerically. ln3≈1.098, b=1.098 / k, but the average is independent of k? Wait, from my calc average =3 - 2 / ln3 ≈3 - 2/1.098 ≈3 -1.821 =1.179. If 3 - (3/2) ln3 ≈3 -1.647*1.098≈3 -1.808 =1.192, close but not. If 3 - 2 ln3 ≈3 -2*1.098=3-2.196=0.804, not. Wait, let's do the integral correctly. The length of interval is b -0 = b = (1/k) ln3, average = (1/b) ∫_0^b f = (1/b) [3x - (1/k) e^{kx}]_0^b = (1/b) [3b - (1/k) e^{k b} + (1/k) e^0 ] = (1/b) [3b - (1/k)*3 + 1/k ] = (1/b) [3b - 2/k ] = 3 - (2/k)/b = 3 - 2/(k b) =3 - 2/ln3 ≈3 -1.821 =1.179. Now, to express 3 - 2/ln3 as a - b ln a. Note that 2/ln3 = 2 log_3 e, but not ln. Perhaps it's 3 log_e 3 - 2 log_e 3 or something, no. From solutions, it has 1 log (3) ... = - (something), but the text has =3 -1, but garbled. Perhaps the form is 2 - ln3, but 2 -1.098=0.902, not. Perhaps b=1, but no. Wait, perhaps the average is (f(0) + f(b))/2 = (3-1 + 3-3)/2 = (2 +0)/2 =1, close to 1.179, but not exact. Since it's exact value, and rule 12 says estimate logically, but to match solutions, the text has a - b log_e (a), and from garbled text, it seems a=3, b=2, but as above not matching, perhaps it's 3 - 2 log_e (3^{1/2}) =3 - ln3 ≈1.902, no. Wait, log_e (3) = ln3, perhaps the form is the average = (3 ln3 -2)/ln3 = 3 - 2/ln3, yes, and 2/ln3 = 2 log_3 e, but since the problem says a - b log_e (a), perhaps it's not exactly, but solutions have it as 3 - 2 log_e (3), but that would be 3 -2 ln3 ≈0.804, but my calc is 1.179, so perhaps error in integral. Wait, e^{k*0} =1, (1/k) e^0 =1/k, so - (1/k) e^{kx} at 0 is - (1/k)*1 = -1/k, so integral = [3x - (1/k) e^{kx}]_0^b = (3b - (1/k)3 ) - (0 - (1/k)1 ) = 3b -3/k +1/k =3b -2/k, yes. Then (1/b) (3b -2/k) =3 - (2/k b), k b = ln3, yes. Perhaps the form is to leave as (3 ln3 -2)/ln3, but the problem says a - b log_e (a), perhaps a= e, but no. Wait, perhaps b is the coefficient, but let's see solutions text: the final =π −=π, no, for this question: average value =1 1 k log e (3) −0 (3−e kx )dx ... then 1 log (3) 0 log (3) 0 log (3)13 log (3) 3 1 1 log (3) 0 log (3) 3 3 1 log (3) Note that 3 .log (3) 32 log (3) log (3) 23 log (3) e e e k k x e e e e e e e e k x e k k e k k k k k k k k , garbled, but it seems the calculation has [ - e^{kx} /k ] , then at upper limit e^{k * (log3 /k)} =3, so -3/k +1/k at lower, so -2/k, and 3x at upper 3 (log3 /k), so integral =3 (ln3 /k) -2/k, average = [3 (ln3 /k) -2/k ] / (ln3 /k ) = [3 ln3 -2 ] / ln3 = 3 - 2/ln3. Now, to express 3 - 2/ln3 as a - b log_e a. Note that ln3 = log_e 3, so 2 / log_e 3 = 2 log_3 e, but the form is a - b log_e a. Perhaps they want it as 3 - 2 log_e (e^{log_e 3 /2}) or something, no. Perhaps the problem has express in form a - b log_e (a), but perhaps a=9, log_e 9 =2 ln3, 2 *2 ln3 =4 ln3, no. Perhaps it's 1 - (1/2) log_e 3 or something, no. Since it's garbled, I will use 3 - 2 / ln(3). But to fit, perhaps the answer is 3 - 2 log_e (3^{1/2}), but no. Wait, note that 2 / ln3 = log_e (3^2) / ln3 = 2 ln3 / ln3 =2, then 3 -2 =1, but that's not, no. The form is the average = (integral) / length = [3 ln3 -2 ] / ln3 k /k wait, no. The 1 / b * integral, b = (1/k) ln3, but the 1 in front is 1 / b = k / ln3, then k / ln3 * (3 (ln3 /k ) -2/k ) = k / ln3 * (3 ln3 /k -2/k ) = k / ln3 * (1/k ) (3 ln3 -2 ) = 1 / ln3 * (3 ln3 -2 ) = 3 - 2 / ln3, yes. Perhaps the form is to write it as 3 log_e 3 - 2 log_e 3 / log_e 3 or something, no. Perhaps they consider log_e (3) as ln3, and b=2, but as numerical not match, perhaps the answer is 3 - 2 log_e (3), but that would be wrong, but perhaps in solutions it's 3 - (1/2) log_e 9 or something, since log_e 9 =2 ln3, (1/2)*2 ln3 = ln3, 3 - ln3 ≈1.902, not 1.179. Perhaps I have the integral wrong. f(x)=3 - e^{kx}, ∫ 3 dx =3x, ∫ - e^{kx} dx = - (1/k) e^{kx}, yes. At x=b, e^{kb} =3, yes. At x=0, e^0 =1, yes. Integral = [3x - (1/k) e^{kx}]_0^b = 3b - (1/k)3 - (0 - (1/k)1 ) =3b -3/k +1/k =3b -2/k, yes. b = ln3 /k, yes. Average = (3b -2/k) / b =3 - (2/k)/b =3 - 2 /(k b) =3 -2 / ln3, yes. Now, to express 3 - 2 / ln3. Note that / ln3 = log_3 e *2, so 3 - 2 log_3 e, but the problem says log_e (a), so log_e a = ln a. Perhaps they want it as a form like 1 - log_e (1/3) or something, no. Perhaps the b in the form is for the coefficient, but since it's positive integers, perhaps they have a different form. From solutions, the text has =3 -1, but garbled, and then (1 mark) (1 mark) , so perhaps the answer is 2 - ln3 or something, but to resolve, I will use the logical 3 - 2/ln(3). But since the problem specifies the form a - b log_e (a), perhaps it's 3 - 1 * log_e (9), since log_e 9 = ln9 =2 ln3 ≈2.197, 3 -2.197=0.803, not. Or a=27, log_e 27 =3 ln3 ≈3.295, 3 -3.295 negative. Perhaps b=1, a such that log_e a =2/ln3, a = e^{2/ln3} =3^{2 / (ln3)^2}, complicated. Perhaps the form is the average = (e^0 + e^{ln3}) /2 or something, no. Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement extraction. The problem says express in the form a - b log_e (a), where a and b positive integers. Perhaps the average is 3/2 - (1/2) log_e 3 or something, 1.5 - 0.5*1.098≈1.5 -0.549=0.951, no. Perhaps the integral is different. Wait, perhaps k is in the exponent, but let's leave it as 3 - 2 log_e (3^{1/ln3}) , no. From solutions, the text has 3log (3) 3 1 1log (3), perhaps it's 3 - 3 log_e (3) /2 or 3 - (3/2) ln3 ≈3 -1.647 =1.353, still not 1.179. (3/2) ln3 ≈1.647, yes. Perhaps the average is the integral divided by length, but perhaps they have different calculation. Let's try to decipher the garbled text. The text has 1 log (3) 0 log (3) 0 log (3)13log (3) 3 1 1log (3) 0log (3) 3 3 1log (3) , perhaps it's [3x - e^{kx}/k ]_0^{log3 /k} / (log3 /k ) , then the [ ] =3 (log3 /k ) - 3/k +1/k =3 log3 /k -2/k, then / (log3 /k ) = [3 log3 -2 ] / log3 =3 -2 / log3 , yes, log = ln. Then the note that 3 . log (3) 32 log (3) log (3) 23 log (3) , perhaps it's 3 - 2 log_e (3^0 ) no. Perhaps they express 2 / ln3 as 2 log_e (3) / (ln3 log_e 3 ) no. Perhaps the form is not exactly matching due to OCR, so I will use the logical expression 3 - 2 / ln(3). For c. Average rate = [f(1) - f(0)] /1 = [3 - e^k - (3 -1)] = 3 - e^k -2 =1 - e^k , negative when 1 - e^k <0, e^k >1, k >0, which is given.",

Wait, f(x) = x sin(π x), f'(x) = sin(π x) + x π cos(π x), at x=1/4, sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈0.707, x π cos = (1/4) π (√2/2) ≈0.25*3.14*0.707≈0.555, total ≈1.262. Now, if (1/2) π +1 ≈1.57 +1=2.57, no. Perhaps the form is (1/4) π + 1/2 , 0.785 +0.5=1.285, close to 1.262, but not exact. Since √2/2 ≈0.707, (π/4) (√2/2) ≈0.785*0.707≈0.555, total 0.707 +0.555=1.262. To express exactly, but the problem says a b c positive integers, so (a/b) π + c, but to match, perhaps they ignore the √2 or something, but no. From solutions: ' ( ) cos( ) sin( ) (product rule) 1' cos sin4 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 ( 4 ) 8 f x x x x f = × π π + π π π π (1 mark) , so f'(1/4) = cos(π/4) + (1/4) sin(π/4) no, product rule u =x, v = sin(π x), u' =1, v' = π cos(π x), f' = u' v + u v' = sin(π x) + x π cos(π x), yes. Then at 1/4, sin(π/4) + (1/4) π cos(π/4) = √2/2 + (π/4) √2/2 = (√2/2) (1 + π/4) = (√2/2) ((4+π)/4) = √2 (4+π)/8 . But the form is (a/b) π + c, but this has √2, perhaps the problem has express in form a π + b / c or something, but PDF says (ab c) π + where a, b and c positive integers, perhaps it's (1 π + 4)/8 or something, no. The text has ( ) ab c π + where a, b and c are positive integers. Perhaps it's π/4 + 1/2, but as numerical close, but not, perhaps they want the expression without evaluating the sin cos, but the problem says at the point x=1/4, so evaluate. Perhaps OCR error in the form, perhaps it's π/4 + sin(π/4) but sin not integer. To resolve, I will use π/4 + 1/2 as approximation, but logically, the exact is √2 (4 + π)/8 , but since rule 12, estimate, but for JSON, I will use the solutions form, from text 1 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 ( 4 ) 8 , perhaps (1/4) π + (1/2) (√2 / √2 ) or something, no. The text has 1' cos sin4 4 4 4, so cos(π/4) = √2/2, but perhaps they want the expression before evaluating, but the problem says find the gradient, express in form (a/b) π + c, perhaps c is the sin part, but sin not integer. Perhaps the point is x=1, but PDF says x=1/4. To proceed, I will put (1/4) π + 1/2 as the form, since 1/2 for sin(π/4) approximate, but actually, since √2/2 ≈0.707, but 1/2=0.5, not good, perhaps the form is π/8 + 1/2 or something, no. Wait, perhaps the product rule is applied differently, but I think the JSON can have the exact, but since the rule is to use valid data from pdf text, the answer_text is the form (1/4) π + 1/2, as per approximate. From solutions, it has 1 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 ( 4 ) 8 , perhaps it's (π +4)/8 , but (3.14 +4)/8 ≈0.893, not 1.262, no. (π +4) √2 /8 ≈7.14 *1.414 /8 ≈10.1 /8 ≈1.26, yes, so the form is perhaps not numerical, but the problem expects the evaluated, but since integers, perhaps they want the expression sin(π/4) + (π/4 ) cos(π/4 ), but not. Perhaps a=1, b=4, c=1, but (1/4) π +1 =0.785 +1 =1.785, no. Perhaps c is negative, but positive. Perhaps the form is a/b π + c/d , but the text has (ab c) π + , perhaps it's a π / b + c, with a=1, b=4, c=1/2, but c not integer. Since it's corrupted, I will use the logical f'(1/4) = sin(π/4) + (π/4) cos(π/4). b. The given is d/dx [ cos(π x) ] = cos(π x) - sin(π x ) / π ? The PDF has ( cos( ) ) cos( ) sin( ) dx x x x x dx π = π − π π , so perhaps d/dx [ x cos(π x ) ] = cos(π x ) - π x sin(π x ), yes, product rule for x cos(π x ), u=x, v= cos(π x ), u' =1, v' = -π sin(π x ), so x' cos + x ( -π sin ) = cos - π x sin, yes. So to find ∫ x sin(π x ) dx , use integration by parts or the given to relate. From solutions, rearranging ( cos(π x ) ) = cos(π x ) - sin(π x ) dx ? Wait, the given is d [ cos(π x ) ] /dx = cos(π x ) - sin(π x ) / π ? The text is garbled, but from solutions, it has rearranging ( cos(π x ) ) cos(π x ) sin(π x ) dx x x x x dx π = π − π π gives sin( ) cos( ) ( cos( ) ) dx x x x x dx π π = π − π so ∫ sin(π x ) x dx = [ x cos(π x ) - ∫ cos(π x ) dx ] / π or something, wait, from integration by parts, ∫ u dv = u v - ∫ v du, let u = x, dv = sin(π x ) dx, du = dx, v = - (1/π ) cos(π x ), so ∫ x sin(π x ) dx = - (x /π ) cos(π x ) - ∫ - (1/π ) cos(π x ) dx = - (x /π ) cos(π x ) + (1/π ) ∫ cos(π x ) dx = - (x /π ) cos(π x ) + (1/π^2 ) sin(π x ) + c. Then to find area | ∫_0^1 x sin(π x ) dx | = | [ - (x /π ) cos(π x ) + (1/π^2 ) sin(π x ) ]_0^1 | = | at 1: - (1/π ) cos(π ) + (1/π^2 ) sin(π ) = - (1/π ) (-1 ) + 0 = 1/π , at 0: -0 cos0 +0 =0 , so ∫ =1/π , and since f(x) = x sin(π x ) >0 on (0,1), area =1/π . Yes, matches solutions. c. From given ∫_0^1 f = π , but wait, from b it's 1/π , but the problem says if ∫_0^1 f(x) dx = π , but that can't be, since we calculated 1/π , perhaps the given is the value, but to find the area, the area is the integral of |f| . From solutions, from part b, ∫_0^1 f =1/π . Then ∫_1^2 f(x -1 ) dx = ∫_0^1 f(u ) du =1/π , but the given is = -3 π , wait, the PDF has ( ) 3 ( 1 ) and ( ) 2 ( ) f x dx f x dx f x dx = − − = , so ∫_0^1 f = π , but that can't be, since calculated 1/π , perhaps the given is the value to use, even if not matching the function, but rule 12 says estimate logically, but to match solutions, the solutions use the calculated 1/π for ∫_0^1 f =1/π , then for ∫_1^2 f(x -1 ) dx = ∫_0^1 f(u ) du =1/π , but the problem says = -3 π , wait, the text has 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 ( ) 3 ( 1 ) and ( ) 2 ( ) f x dx f x dx f x dx f x dx = − − = , so ∫_0^1 f = π , ∫_1^2 f(x -1 ) dx = -3 π , ∫_2^3 f =2 ∫_0^1 f =2 π . Then the area is ∫_0^1 |f| + | ∫_1^2 f(x -1 ) | + | ∫_2^3 f | , but since the values are given, but to find the enclosed area, which is the total area between curve and x-axis, so |∫_0^1| + |∫_1^2 f(x-1)| + |∫_2^3| = |π| + |-3π| + |2π| = π +3π +2π =6π , but solutions have 9 π , wait, no, solutions have 1 π +3 π +5 π =9 π . From solutions: From part b., ∫_0^1 f =1/π . Note that ∫_1^2 f(x -1 ) dx = ∫_0^1 f(u ) du =1/π , but the problem has = -3 π , but perhaps the given is the value for the integral, but the PDF has if ... = π , but perhaps OCR error, the solutions ignore the given and use the calculated, and for the intervals, the function f(x) = x sin(π x ), on [0,1] positive, integral 1/π . On [1,2], f(x) = x sin(π x ), sin(π x ) from π to 2π , negative, so area = - ∫_1^2 f(x) dx . But to compute ∫_1^2 f(x) dx , using the same antiderivative - (x /π ) cos(π x ) + (1/π^2 ) sin(π x ) _1^2 = at 2: -2/π cos(2π ) +1/π^2 sin(2π ) = -2/π (1) +0 = -2/π , at 1: -1/π cos(π ) +1/π^2 sin(π ) = -1/π (-1 ) +0 =1/π , so ∫_1^2 = -2/π -1/π = -3/π , so area on [1,2] = - ∫ =3/π . For [2,3], f(x) = x sin(π x ), sin from 2π to 3π , positive from 2 to 2.5, negative 2.5 to 3? Wait, sin(π x ) at x=2 sin(2π)=0, x=2.5 sin(2.5π )= sin(450 deg)= sin(90)=1? Wait, 2.5 π = 2.5 *180 =450 =360+90, sin90=1, x=3 sin(3π)=0. But sin(π x ) for x in [2,3], π x in [2π,3π ], sin from 0 to sin(2.5π )=sin(π/2 +2π )=1, then to sin(3π )=0, but sin is positive in [2π, 3π ]? Wait, from 2π to 5π/2 =2.5π , sin from 0 to 1, then from 2.5π to 3π = sin from 1 to 0, but 3π is 540 deg =180 deg +360, sin180=0, but from 450 to 540, 450=90 mod 360, sin90=1, 540=180 mod 360, sin180=0, but the sin function in third quadrant is negative? Wait, sin(θ ) for θ from 2π to 3π , 360 to 540 deg, from 360 to 450 (90 deg effective) sin positive, 450 to 540 (90 to 180) sin positive to 0, wait, sin is positive in first and second quadrant, from 0 to 180 deg effective, yes, so sin(π x ) >0 on (2,3), so ∫_2^3 f(x) dx >0, area = ∫_2^3 f. From solutions, ∫_2^3 f =5/π , how? The antiderivative at 3: -3/π cos(3π ) +1/π^2 sin(3π ) = -3/π (-1 ) +0 =3/π , at 2: -2/π (1 ) = -2/π , so ∫_2^3 =3/π - (-2/π ) =5/π , yes. So area on [2,3] =5/π . Total area =1/π +3/π +5/π =9/π . And the given in c. is to use those relations, but in PDF it's if ∫_0^1 f = π , but likely OCR error, the relations are to show the values, but solutions use the calculated, and the if is to indicate the values are π but scaled, but logically the area is 9/π . d. i. Dilation by 1/3 from y-axis means horizontal compression by 3, so domain [0,3] becomes [0,1], then reflect in y-axis, [-1,0]. ii. Dilation replace x with 3x, f(3x) =3x sin(π 3x ), then reflect replace x with -x, f(3 (-x)) =3 (-x ) sin(π 3 (-x )) = -3 x sin( - 3 π x ) = -3 x ( - sin(3 π x ) ) = 3 x sin(3 π x ), wait, sin odd, sin(-θ ) = - sin θ , so -3x * ( - sin(3 π x ) ) = 3x sin(3 π x ), but solutions have 3 sin( 3 ) g x x x = − − π , wait, -3 x sin(3 π ( - x ) wait, for g(x) = f(3 ( - x ) ) wait, dilation first f(3 x ), then reflect g(x ) = f(3 ( - x ) ) = ( - x ) sin( π ( - 3 x ) wait, no, f(z) = z sin(π z ), z =3 x for dilation, but dilation by factor 1/3 from y-axis means the graph is compressed horizontally by factor 3, so new function h(x) = f(3 x ), domain [0,3] to [0,1], then reflect in y-axis, g(x) = h( - x ) = f(3 ( - x ) ) = f( - 3 x ) = ( - 3 x ) sin( π ( - 3 x ) ) = -3 x sin( - 3 π x ) = -3 x ( - sin(3 π x ) ) = 3 x sin(3 π x ), but solutions have 3 sin(3 ) g x x x = π , yes, and the equivalent -3 x sin(3 π ( - x ) ) no, but the text has 3 sin( 3 ) y x x = − − π , perhaps for the reflection. But the equivalent answer of g(x) = 3 x sin(3 π x ) is also acceptable, yes.",
